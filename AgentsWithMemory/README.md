## Objective:

The core of this project will be to set up and experiment with different type of memories. The memories will be of 3 types:

- Semantic memory: remember facts about the user. This is intended for user's personalization
- Episodic memory: this will be used to remember past actions in specific situations, for instance, changing the behavior with respect to a specific email sender.
- Procedural memory: able to modify the whole system state.
