# First Draft

## Purpose of the Repo

As I build a chatbot for booking reservations, I'll be exploring several technologies and workflows new to me.

### Tools that I will explore:

- The use of uv as package installer.
- The use of gradio as the chatbot interface.
- The inclusion of multimodal AI responses: text, audio and image. I will use dall-e-3, whisper, and three different model's apis, which are openai, claude and deepseek.
- I will use MCP to make the booking call. I will try to do this by adding a langraph agent to the chatbot in order to make it automatically and thinking about adding more tools in the future.
- I will try to create a backend to include long term history for the chatbot.
